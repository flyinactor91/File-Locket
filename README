Overview:
Simple file storage service
Store, access, and delete files

Client:
Saves username, sessionID, and user preferences between sessions
--User prefs: senddir , destdir
User can set different send and dest folders for files to/from server
--Defauts to curdir but saves send/dest between sessions

Server:
Files stored on the server do not undergo further encryption
--File encryption on the list to implement
Database stored as two dictionaries and saved between command loops
--UserStorage = { username : [encrypted password , current sessionID] , ...}
--FileStorage = { username : { filename : [datetime uploaded , checksum] , ...} , ...}

Security:
Passwords are salted and hashed client side so server never sees the plain text
All password entry doesn't show text in terminal
User's sessionID changes upon new login -> user can only transmit new commands on one machine at a time
--Large file upload will continue even if user moves to new terminal changing sessionID
Option to change password will not be added until user authentication

Admin tools:
Client asked for admin password which must match encrypted server password
Admin can shutdown server remotely
Adminclear saves a backup of database by renaming ~bin and making new blank bin folder
--Previous backup must be manually removed before next clear

Upgrades for future releases:
	~~~~Choose dest directory upon getfile
	Folder support
	Up arrow yields previous entries
	File encryption (user-held keys)
	File versioning (base already implemented)
	User account support/authentication
	Optional GUI (much later)

	sendfile		Send a file to the server
	getfile			Get a file from the server
