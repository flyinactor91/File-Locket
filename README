File Locket
Created by Michael duPont (flyinactor91@gmail.com)
v1.1.0a [15 04 2013]
Python 2.7.4 - Unix

Overview:
Simple file storage service
Store, access, and delete files
Files are versioned and can be downloaded

Client:
Saves username, sessionID, and user preferences between sessions
--User prefs: senddir , destdir
User can set different send and dest folders for files to/from server
--Defauts to curdir but saves send/dest between sessions

Server:
File encryption on the list to implement
Database stored as two dictionaries and saved between command loops
Server log is recorded into .txt (default) or to the terminal
Critical errors (problems with code, not user error) are tracked

Security:
Passwords are salted and hashed client side so server never sees the plain text
All password entry doesn't show text in terminal
User's sessionID changes upon new login -> user can only transmit new commands on one machine at a time
--Large file upload will continue even if user moves to new terminal changing sessionID

Admin tools:
Client asked for admin password which must match encrypted server password
Admin can shutdown server remotely
Adminclear saves a backup of database by renaming ~bin and making new blank bin folder
--Previous backup must be manually removed before next clear

Upgrades for future releases:
	Folder support
	Up arrow yields previous entries
	File encryption (user-held keys)
	User account support/authentication
	Optional GUI (much later)
