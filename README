v1.0.0 [28 03 2013]
Python 2.7.3 - Unix

Simple file storage service.
Files stored on the server do not undergo further encryption.
Passwords are "deliciously salted" and hashed client side so your precious digits are secure.
Admin clear saves a backup of all files and storage dictionaries.

Upgrades for future releases:
	Choose dest directory upon getfile
	Up arrow yields previous entries
	File encryption (user-held keys)
	File versioning (base already implemented)
	User account support/authentication
	Optional GUI (much later)



Available commands:

	sendfile		Send a file to the server
	getfile			Get a file from the server
	showfiles		Show stored files
	delfile			Delete a file on the server
	test			Test server connection
	logout			Logout and quit
	quit			Quit without logging out
	
Admin Tools (requires admin/server pw):
