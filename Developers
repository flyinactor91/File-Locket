A brief overview of data structures and improvements/issues


Client:
userSets = {'senddir':locationString , 'destdir':locationString}
Storage pickle save/load order: userName, sessionID, userSets
File encryption would be implemented with client-side keys before transmission
--Currently trying to work out how to store key-derivation on server for when client logs into a new session
Up arrow yields previous text entries
--Trying to find module to replace raw_input that works with arrow key keyboard event


Server:
UserStorage = { username : [encrypted password , current sessionID] , ...}
FileStorage = { username : { filename : [datetime uploaded , checksum , [list of version datetimes]] , ...} , ...}
Folder support is tricky due to viewfile lists and how file versioning is set up
Scaling will be a problem
--Search algorithms are O(N) --major problem
--No inherent multithreading, serves only one user at a time (untested for multiple-user large file transfers)
Account authentication would come through email with server-generated random string for user to send to server
