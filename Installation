Installation Notes:

Usage: sudo python setup.py (   /-client/-server) (-link)

The setup.py file must have root permissions


Nothing after setup.py does the full install (client+server)
-client installs just client into /usr/local/bin/filelocket/client
-server installs just server into /usr/local/bin/filelocket/server

-link installs links to curent location (directory) of client and server
-client -link installs just client link
-server -link installs just server link


Links are updated whenever setup.py is installed.
Ex. -client -link overrides -client (no link)
